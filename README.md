# Teensy_SDR
Software defined radio using Teensy 3.1, Teensy Audio shield and Softrock

This is a software defined radio using the Arduino compatible Teensy 3.1 and audio shield from PJRC. 
It takes advantage of the audio library supplied by PJRC to implement the audio signal processing chain.

Dependencies - most of these libraries are available from PJRC and can be installed with the Teensyduino package:

Audio (Teensy Audio library),
SD (not used but needed for the audio libraries to compile),
SPI,
Wire,
Metro,
Bounce,
Encoder,
SI5351 (github.com/NT7S/Si5351),
Adafruit Graphics library (adafruit.com),
Driver for your display (I used a Banggood knockoff of the AdaFruit 1.8" TFT)
